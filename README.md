Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median.

NOTE: Return the floor value of the median.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 5
arr[] = 90 100 78 89 67
Output: 89
Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: N = 4
arr[] = 56 67 30 79
Output: 61
Explanation: In case of even number of 
elements, average of two middle elements 
is the median.
```
